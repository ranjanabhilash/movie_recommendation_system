Simple RecommenderÂ¶
The Simple Recommender offers generalized recommnendations to every user based on movie popularity
and (sometimes) genre. The basic idea behind this recommender is that movies that are more popular and
more critically acclaimed will have a higher probability of being liked by the average audience. This model
does not give personalized recommendations based on the user.
The implementation of this model is extremely trivial. All we have to do is sort our movies based on ratings
and popularity and display the top movies of our list. As an added step, we can pass in a genre argument to
get the top movies of a particular genre.
